% This is my general purpose LaTeX header file for writing German documents.
% Ideally, you include this using a simple ``\input{header.tex}`` in your main
% document and start with ``\title`` and ``\begin{document}`` afterwards.

% If you need to add additional packages, I recommend not doing this in this
% file, but in your main document. That way, you can just drop in a new
% ``header.tex`` and get all the new commands without having to merge manually.

% Since this file encorporates a CC-BY-SA fragment, this whole files is
